**Introduction:**
This is a mobile app that acts like an anonymous discussion forum for Harvard-Westlake students. It allows users to post content and engage in discussions while maintaining their anonymity. The primary target audience for this platform is all the high school students at a particular school, providing a secure space for open and honest conversations.

**Value/Use:**
By allowing for anonymity, it reduces the fear of judgment, making it an ideal platform for students to discuss various topics that they otherwise wouldn't be comfortable sharing in person.
 
**User Interaction and Experience:**
Users will have a seamless and intuitive experience on our platform. They can post discussion boards, comment on posts, and like or dislike content. The anonymity feature encourages users to be more open and authentic in their interactions.

**Competitive Element:**
There could be subtopics as "Rate my Teacher" or "Which classes to avoid" or "Anonymous Confessions" to drive up engagement. Not necessarily competitive though.

**Engagement and Addictiveness Strategies:**
To keep users engaged and addicted to the platform, implementing features like daily discussion prompts and a trending topics section might help

**Scalability and Expansion:**
This platform can be expanded to other schools, fostering a larger community of high school students. Regular updates and enhancements will ensure its relevance over time.

**Accessibility and Inclusivity:**
No students will be barred from making an account and expressing their own opinions. However, if the speech incites violence of any kind it will be taken down.
